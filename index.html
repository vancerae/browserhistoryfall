  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The web browser is one of the most important applications in the modern computing landscape. It serves as a gateway to the vast universe of the internet, enabling users to view websites, run applications, and interact with content. In many ways, the browser has become the platform of platforms: it is not only a viewer for information but also a stage for commerce, education, entertainment, and social connection.
  </p>
  <p>
    From the early days of text-heavy pages and dial-up modems to today’s rich, interactive experiences, browsers have evolved significantly in speed, standards compliance, and usability. Early browsers often struggled with inconsistent rendering of websites and limited support for images, multimedia, and advanced layout. Over time, competition between major vendors encouraged rapid improvements in performance and user experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Modern browsers support a wide range of features that enable everything from simple document reading to high-performance gaming, video conferencing, 3D graphics, and cloud-based productivity suites. They integrate tools for developers, privacy settings for users, and layers of security to protect against malicious activity. Features such as tabbed browsing, bookmarking, extensions, and synchronization across devices have transformed browsers into essential tools for daily life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Browsers are also at the heart of innovation on the web. They enforce standards set by organizations such as the W3C, and their adoption of technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript APIs has made possible everything from streaming movies to editing documents collaboratively in real time. Without modern browsers, the web as we know it would not exist.

    <h2>A brief history of IE</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="img/ie.svg" alt="IE Logo" width="100" class="inline-logo logo-left">
      Internet Explorer (IE) was Microsoft’s flagship browser for more than two decades. First released in 1995 as part of the Windows 95 operating system, it quickly gained popularity because it was bundled directly with Windows. By the early 2000s, Internet Explorer commanded over 90% of the browser market, effectively shaping the way millions of people accessed the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite its dominance, IE became notorious for its security vulnerabilities, slow adoption of modern web standards, and inconsistent rendering of websites. Web developers often had to write special code just to accommodate Internet Explorer quirks. This led to frustration and slowed down progress on a more open, standardized web.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, newer browsers like Firefox and Chrome eroded IE’s market share. Microsoft attempted to modernize the experience with later versions, but its reputation was already damaged. Eventually, Microsoft replaced Internet Explorer with Microsoft Edge, signaling the end of an era. Today, IE is remembered as both a trailblazer in bringing the web to the masses and a cautionary tale about the risks of stagnation in technology.

    <h2>A brief history of Firefox</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="img/firefox.png" alt="Firefox Logo" width="100" class="inline-logo logo-left">
      Mozilla Firefox was launched in 2004 as a direct challenge to Internet Explorer’s dominance. Built by the Mozilla Foundation, an open-source organization, Firefox emphasized speed, security, and adherence to web standards. It quickly gained a loyal following, especially among developers and power users who valued customization and transparency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firefox introduced features that are now standard across browsers, such as tabbed browsing, pop-up blocking, and a vibrant ecosystem of extensions. It also focused heavily on user privacy, giving individuals more control over cookies, tracking, and history management. Its open-source model allowed the community to contribute directly to development, making it a symbol of the open web movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      At its peak, Firefox captured nearly one-third of the global browser market. Although Google Chrome later surpassed it, Firefox continues to evolve with innovations like multi-process architecture, advanced developer tools, and strong privacy protections such as Enhanced Tracking Protection. To this day, it remains a preferred browser for users who prioritize openness, customization, and privacy.

  <section id="chrome">
    <h2>A brief history of Chrome</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="img/chrome.svg" alt="Chrome Logo" width="100" class="inline-logo logo-left">
      Google Chrome debuted in 2008 and quickly transformed the browser landscape. Its minimalist design focused on maximizing the viewing area for web content, and its powerful V8 JavaScript engine delivered unmatched speed. These features, combined with seamless integration into Google’s ecosystem, propelled Chrome to widespread adoption within just a few years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chrome emphasized stability by isolating each tab and extension into its own process, reducing crashes and improving security. It also made frequent, automatic updates a norm, ensuring users always had the latest features and protections without needing to manually install updates. The browser’s support for modern web technologies encouraged developers to build richer, faster, and more interactive web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chrome’s open-source foundation, Chromium, became the base for other browsers like Microsoft Edge, Opera, and Brave. This has made the Chromium engine a de facto standard in the industry, though it has also raised concerns about too much consolidation around a single technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, Chrome remains the world’s most widely used browser, known for its speed, synchronization across devices, and integration with services like Gmail and Google Drive. While critics point to its heavy memory usage and privacy concerns tied to Google’s data collection, Chrome continues to set the pace for innovation on the web.
