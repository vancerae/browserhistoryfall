    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The web browser is one of the most important applications in the modern computing landscape. It serves as a gateway to the vast universe of the internet, enabling users to view websites, run applications, and interact with content.</p>
    <p>From the early days of Netscape Navigator to today’s feature-rich applications, browsers have evolved significantly in speed, standards compliance, and usability.</p>
    <p>Modern browsers support a wide range of features that enable everything from simple document reading to high-performance gaming. Learn more about this evolution from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser" target="_blank">this Wikipedia article on web browsers</a>.</p>

    <h2>A brief history of IE</h2>

    <p>Internet Explorer (IE) was Microsoft's entry into the browser market, first released in 1995. It quickly gained dominance thanks to its inclusion with Windows operating systems.</p>
    <p>Although it once held more than 90% of the browser market, it eventually fell out of favor due to security issues and lack of modern web standards support. Microsoft eventually replaced it with Edge.</p>
    <p>Microsoft’s current browser can be found at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/edge" target="_blank">the Microsoft Edge website</a>.</p>

    <p>Firefox, developed by Mozilla, was released in 2004 as a response to the stagnation in browser innovation. It prioritized open standards, speed, and user privacy.</p>
    <p>Firefox gained a strong user base and contributed to breaking Internet Explorer’s dominance in the mid-2000s. It remains popular among privacy-conscious users and developers.</p>

    <h2>A brief history of Chrome</h2>
    <img src="img/Google_Chrome_icon_(February_2022).svg" alt="Chrome Logo" width="100">
    <p>Google Chrome was launched in 2008 and quickly grew to become the most widely used browser in the world. It introduced a minimal user interface and emphasized performance through its V8 JavaScript engine.</p>
    <p>Chrome's open-source foundation, Chromium, also powers other browsers like Microsoft Edge and Opera. Chrome remains a major influence in modern web standards.</p>
